//Choose a pivot value. We take the value of the middle element as pivot value,
// but it can be any value, which is in range of sorted values, even if it doesn't present in the array.
//Partition. Rearrange elements in such a way, that all elements which are lesser 
// than the pivot go to the left part of the array and all elements greater than the pivot,
//go to the right part of the array. Values equal to the pivot can stay in any part of the array. Notice, that array may be divided in non-equal parts.
//Sort both parts. Apply quicksort algorithm recursively to the left and the right parts.
